The Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) was invented by Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz and is also called suffix Notation. No parentheses are required, and operators and operators come after operands. For example, (1-2)*(4+5) represents the following:
// Reverse Polish expression notation, also known as postfix expression
1, 2, - 4, 5 + *

The project implements an inverse Polish calculator.



逆波兰表达式（Reverse Polish Notation, RPN）是由波兰逻辑学家Jan.Lukasiewicz发明，也叫后缀表达式。特点是不需要括号，且操作符、运算符在操作数后面。比如，(1-2)*(4+5)表示如下：
// 逆波兰表达式表示法，也即后缀表达式 
1 2 - 4 5 + *

该项目实现了一个逆波兰计算器。
